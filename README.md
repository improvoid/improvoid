I'm Steven Kraninger AKA ImprovOid

I have been programming software and playing music for a LONG time.

Lately I have been learning about Audio Software, DSP, IOT, and real time programming.

Most of the programming I have done (and am still doing) is buisiness applications using Visual Studio and the C#, VB.NET stacks.

The new Audio Programming is being done in C++ using the JUCE framework and Faust based DSP code.

I have also been developing some audio boxes using the Axoloti audio IOT platform.
It is a STM32 based IOT device that has some very nice USB, MIDI, Interfacting, and Audio capability
It has a very nice graphical development environment similar to PD that compiles to C++ code, then to real time code for the Axoloti.

My current repositories represent some Free and Open Source VSTs that can be used in hosts that support 64 bit VST3's.
They could be ported to other platforms quite easily, and may be by this time you read this.
